  someone say the email difference, the github won't show my submit today ,so I change my email same to github for a text.
  also, I add coding.net for my remote storage because it has app.
  also I add multi-user but have ssh-agent bash first, ssh-add ~... second...
I think multi-user have no use, in prime,I think multi-user have own email so I can show difference email.but I find it don't have today.
  this is fork.
  checkout develop branch, in order to test ff merge. when not use --no-ff,it show a fast foward merge,this time. when I use --no-ff, can see the develop branch. when I push ,I find github not show, so check email not correct, correct it.
  well, when I correct the email address,it doesn't show also,why?when changed the response name remote,can I need change local?
